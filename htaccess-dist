# explicidly set relative URL of Hotglue files.
# this might be nessesary on some hosts which use
# funky redirects before serving the contents of 'docroot'.
# SYMPTOMS: white screen, /edit does not work, authentication does not work.
# SOLUTION: set 'RewriteBase' to the last part of Hotglue URL,
# ie: '/hotglue' (no quotes) if the URL is http://mysite.me/hotglue
## RewriteBase /hotglue

# this seems to be needed for authentication if php is working in cgi mode
