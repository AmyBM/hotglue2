You will be asked for your username and password, and once you have entered those you are in 'editing mode'!

Once in editing mode:
- A single click anywhere (on an empty canvas) gives you a toolset to add new elements, for example a text field.
- A double click gives you a toolset that allows you to change the properties of a page, or make a new one.
- Adding .PNG or .JPEG images can simply be done by drag-and-drop action, that goes for animated GIF too!
