KNOWN ISSUES

  * Hotglue 1.0 is not compatible with prior versions of the software. We aim 
    to preserve compatibility with upcoming releases though.
  
  * If you receive an error message while uploading a large file this 
    might  be due to the limits set in the servers's php.ini file.
    You might want to change the values of these settings:
    - post_max_size
    - upload_max_filesize
    - memory-limit (if memory limits have been enabled)
    - max_input_time
    - max_file_uploads

  * When modifying objects that also appear on other pages, these changes might not immediately appear on them if caching is enabled.

  * Rewrite rules in the Apache configuration or in any parent directory .htaccess file can clash with the Hotglue one.

  * On certain shared hosts we have seen issues with digest authentication (see AUTH_METHOD configuration option). For those hosts basic authentication has to be used.
